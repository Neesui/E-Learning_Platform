E-Learning Platform 📚✨
This E-Learning Platform is a web-based system designed to provide free access to a variety of courses, enabling students to learn at their own pace from anywhere. The platform leverages advanced recommendation algorithms to ensure students receive personalized suggestions for courses that suit their preferences and interests.

🚀 Project Overview
The platform aims to make education accessible and engaging by offering video lectures, quizzes, and interactive features. It provides personalized course recommendations based on student activity and preferences, making learning more efficient and enjoyable.
The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) for a dynamic and scalable user experience.

📊 Recommendation Approach
Hybrid Recommendation System:
Content-Based Filtering:
Recommends courses based on their attributes such as category, difficulty level, and tags.

The system evaluates courses a student has previously enrolled in or liked.
It identifies similar courses by comparing attributes, ensuring recommendations align with the student's interests.
For example, if a student enrolls in "Introduction to Web Development," the platform might recommend "HTML Basics" or "JavaScript for Beginners."
